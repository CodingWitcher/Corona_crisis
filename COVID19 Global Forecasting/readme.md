# COVID-19 Global Forecasting 

![Coronavirus](https://github.com/CodingWitcher/Corona_crisis/blob/master/COVID19%20Global%20Forecasting/EDA%20Snapshots/COVID-19.jpg)

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall on floors or surfaces. 
One can be infected by breathing in the virus if one is within close proximity of someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth.

More information about this deadly virus(along with prevention tips and mandatory precautions) can be found on the World Health Organization(WHO)'s webpage. Other information resources are as follows:
* https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019 
* https://www.google.com/intl/en_in/covid19/
* https://www.mygov.in/covid-19


In this project, we aim to predict not only the **cumulative number of confirmed COVID19 cases** but also the approximate **resulting fatalities** in various locations across the world. 

For analyzing this, the entire problem was evaluated using * Time - Series modeling* approach, by looking at the past data as reported from the month of January by John Hopkins University. The data set is uploaded in this project's sub directory itself. The same data set can also be found on the Kaggle platform itself : 
* https://www.kaggle.com/c/covid19-global-forecasting-week-4/data

All the *.ipynb* notebooks were created using Kaggle's Jupyter notebooks, and were executed using *NVidia K80 GPUs.*

## COVID-19 DATASET

As mentioned above, the dataset is made publically available(*credits : John Hopkins University*). Copy of the files are uploaded in this projecty's directory as well. The data set composes of the following files : 
* train.csv - the training data containing the cumulative predicted as well as fatal cases observed in the previous months, all across the globe.
* test.csv - the dates to predict.

## Notebook Design Structure

### globalforecast-confirmedcases.ipynb and parts of globalForecast-fatalcases.ipynb:

### PART 1 : Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)

* **1. Importing necessary Python3 modules** :
  * **Numpy** : NumPy(Numerical Python) is a python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.
  * **Pandas** : Pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with 'relationa' or 'labeled' data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python.
  * **Matplotlib** : Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python3 programming language.
  * **Plotly** : Like Matplotlib, Plotly is also a plotting library. The sole aim of importing it here was to make use of its submodule in order to create *choropleth* map for a visual global analysis later. 
  * **Bokeh** : Similarily, Bokeh is also an interactive visualization library for modern web browsers. We import this so that the *choropleth* visualization can be rendered on the committed Jupyter notebook, running on the Google Chrome or any other web browser.
  * **sklearn** : Scikit-learn provides a range of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms via a consistent interface in Python. The library is focused on preprocessing/modeling data. It is not focused on loading, manipulating and summarizing data. For these features, we refer to NumPy and Pandas. 
  * **Tensorflow** : Is a deep learning framework encapsulating comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML, and developers easily build and deploy ML powered applications.

* **2. Loading the COVID-19 dataset** :

  Using Pandas library the datasets were read and subsequently converted into dataframes, for easier Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) and     data pre-processing. 

* **3. Fill the missing values** :

  Using *pandas.fillna()* function, the missing values in the dataframe were replaced by the chosen values.
   * Empty values in Provinces column are assigned to NULL value.
   * Empty values in Confirmed cases column are assigned the value NULL.
   * Empty values in Fatalities case column are also assigned NULL value.

* **4. Grouping cases together** :

    Since we were given a time-series data of various countries around the world, corresponding to the number of confirmed cases       and fatalities observed, we aim to ouput the total number of confirmed cases and fatalities observed on various dates in a               particular country/region. This was accomplished in the dataframe using *groupby()* function available in Pandas library. 

* **5. Plotting country wise results** :
    
    Now that we had extracted the confirmed cases as well as fatality count according to dates, for each country in the dataframe; step     two was initiated where *matplotlib* was used in order to plot these counts over time. To enable comparitive study, counts of some         countries were plotted against each other. Here I have plotted the counts of the following countries : 
    
     * The United States of America
     * Italy
     * Republic of India
     * France
     * China
     * Taiwan
     * The United Kingdom

* **6. Combining country and provinces into region** :
    
    In this section, *Country_Region* and *Province_State* were combined under one header, that is *Region*. Subsequently, the                 Country_Region and Province_State column were removed in order to combine two features into a single one. This feature pre-           processing aids us in effectively summing the essence of two features into one, simultaneously narrowing down the dimensional             structure of the feature matrix fed to the deep neural networks.
    
* **7. Data Exploration via Choropleth maps** : 
   
    Choropleth maps are popular maps used to represent statistical data through various shading patterns or symbols on                       predetermined geographic areas (i.e. countries). They are good at utilizing data to easily represent variability of the desired         measurement, across a region. Since we are given the data of various countries, Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) via choropleth maps       seems a suitable option.
    
    In order to accomplish this, we employ the *choropleth()* function incorporated in the *plotly.express* module. Two Choropleth maps     were plotted in order to depict the **global growth** of the coronavirus pandemic.
    Down below are the snapshots in order of :
     * Globally confirmed COVID-19 cases in January, taken at timestamp 0 in the generated choropleth map.
     * Globally cofirmed COVID-19 cases in April, taken at the final timestamp in April, in the generated choropleth map.
     * Globally fatal COVID-19 cases in January, taken at timestamp 0 in the generated choropleth map.
     * Globally fatal COVID-19 cases in April, taken at the final timestamp in April, in the generated choropleth map.

   ```diff
   - Github can't support the display of Choropleth map or dynamic(race) graphs. Hence these outputs can only be truly visualized with the passage of time on these same notebooks committed on Kaggle platform.

   ```

* **8. Generating a bar chart race to compare the growth of COVID-19(EDA Phase 2)** : 

    The race chart was generated using **Flourish Studio**, which helps coders/journalists/researchers create easy data visualizations. More information about this service can be found at : *https://flourish.studio/*. However, the data is expected to be in a specific format before the studio can render the chart race. The required template/format is available on : *https://app.flourish.studio/@flourish/bar-chart-race*. Our data was also manipulated to fit the aforementioned template description using the *pandas.pivot()* function, which was then exported in *.csv* format and uploaded on the Flourish studio web page. The bar chart race settings were tweaked according to the instructions on the studio page, and the subsequent visualization was created. All that was left was to embed the visualization in our *.ipynb* notebook, which was accomplished using the *IPython.display.HTML()* command. 
    
    Following are the excerpts from the bar chart race. The entire race is available on the uploaded notebook at Kaggle(*https://www.kaggle.com/fireheart7/globalforecast-confirmedcases*). Excerpts 1-4 are pasted below : 
    
     * Excerpt I : January 24, 2020   | Global confirmed cases : 939
     * Excerpt II : February 24, 2020 | Global confirmed cases : 79,659
     * Excerpt III : March 24, 2020   | Global confirmed cases : 433,460
     * Excerpt IV : April 11, 2020    | Global Confirmed Cases : 2,401,199

### PART 2 : Data pre-processing

* **Converting date values to datetime using Pandas** :

For time stamps, Pandas provides the Timestamp data type, which is essentially a replacement for Python's native datetime , but is based on the more efficient numpy. datetime64 data type. This should be treated as Pandas custom data structure for efficient implementations and information extraction. All the values in 'Date' column are converted into timestamps using *pandas.to_datetime()* function. 

* **Extracting information from date** :

By constructing a function, we extract the corresponding date and month as numeric values, from the aforementioned timestamp date column. For this, all the values in datetime column were first converted into *pydatetime* format, which would have been only possible if the initial values were in *timestamp* appearance. After all this extraction, the values were appended under two new columns, that is 'Month' and 'Day'. Also, the original column containing dates was removed. Also, the primary index was also altered to "Id" rather than the Pandas generated auto indices. 

* **Encoding Region** : 

*Label Encoder* : In order to convert categorical text data into model-understandable numerical data, we use the Label Encoder class. So all we had to do, to label encode the *Region* column, was to import the LabelEncoder class from the sklearn library, fit and transform the *Region* column of the data, and then replace the existing text data with the new encoded data. Also, since the count of fatal and confirmed cases can't be in fractions, hence we explicitly type cast the values to *Integer* format. 

* **Splitting data into training and validation set** :

For training purposes we have kept 90% of the data under the *training* category, and remaining 10% under *hold out cross-validation* category(or simply *validation set*).

* **Feature Scaling** :

For scaling the *Month* and *Day* features, we employ the *MinMaxScaler* available in the sklearn. The feature range is set to be between (0,1). The primary reason we went for scaling was to make our data points representation in the n-dimensional space more symmetrical, which in turn aid the gradient descent to converge faster and effectively.

* **Creating Dataset for LSTM** :

One can't simply feed the Numpy array/tensor to a neural network to obtain the results. Every neural network is designed to take in inputs of a specific shapes. In our model we create 3-D Numpy tensors, having two sets of training examples in a batch(size = 1), each composing of three features. 


**A Note on Tensors** : Tensors are the primary data structure used in deep learning, inputs, outputs everything within a neural network is represented using Tensors. In short, a tensor is a multidimensional array, that is an nd-array. A number is a zero-dimensional Tensor, a vector is a one-dimensional Tensor and an n-dimensional array is an n-dimensional Tensor. A Tensor is a generalization whereas number, vector, etc. are specific cases of a Tensor. The rank of a tensor is the number of dimensions of that tensor.
Following figure will aid in visualization of tensors :

### PART 3 : Designing the neural network using the deep learning framework - Tensorflow 2.0

* **LSTM Design** :

Long Short Term Memory networks – usually just called “LSTMs” – are a special kind of RNN, capable of learning long-term dependencies. LSTMs are explicitly designed to avoid the long-term dependency problem. Remembering information for long periods of time is practically their default behavior, not something they struggle to learn. All recurrent neural networks have the form of a chain of repeating modules of neural network. In standard RNNs, this repeating module will have a very simple structure, such as a single tanh layer.

![](https://github.com/CodingWitcher/Corona_crisis/blob/master/COVID19%20Global%20Forecasting/EDA%20Snapshots/RNN%20repeating%20module.png)


LSTMs also have this chain like structure, but the repeating module has a different structure. Instead of having a single neural network layer, there are four, interacting in a very special way.

![](https://github.com/CodingWitcher/Corona_crisis/blob/master/COVID19%20Global%20Forecasting/EDA%20Snapshots/LSTM%20repeating%20module.png)


In the above diagram, each line carries an entire vector, from the output of one node to the inputs of others. The pink circles represent pointwise operations, like vector addition, while the yellow boxes are learned neural network layers. Lines merging denote concatenation, while a line forking denote its content being copied and the copies going to different locations.

More information on LSTM is available this amazing page : **https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/**

* **Prediction** : 

The trained model was ultimately fed the testing data and the output was exported as *.csv* file.
