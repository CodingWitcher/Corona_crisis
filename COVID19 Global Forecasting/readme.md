# COVID-19 Global Forecasting 

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall on floors or surfaces. 
One can be infected by breathing in the virus if one is within close proximity of someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth.

More information about this deadly virus(along with prevention tips and mandatory precautions) can be found on the World Health Organization(WHO)'s webpage. Other information resources are as follows:

In this project, I aim to predict not only the COVID-19 **confirmed cases** but also the approximate **fatalities** that may be encountered in the month of April, on specific dates as given in the testing data set. For analyzing this, the entire problem was evaluated using * Time - Series modeling* approach, by looking at the past data as reported from the month of January by John Hopkins University. The data set is uploaded in this project's sub directory itself. The same data set can also be found on Kaggle itself :
