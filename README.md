# Corona_crisis
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease was first identified in 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since spread globally, 
resulting in the 2019â€“20 coronavirus pandemic.

The better we can track the virus, the better we can fight it. By analyzing
different parameters responsible for the outbreak of coronavirus, we can take
controlling measures in an accelerated way.

Here, I have tried to employ Deep Learning in order to analyze the unfortunate situation during 
the global crisis of COVID-19.
