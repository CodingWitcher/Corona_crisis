Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease was first identified in 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since spread globally, resulting in the 2019â€“20 coronavirus pandemic.

The better we can track the virus, the better we can fight it. By analyzing different parameters responsible for the outbreak of coronavirus, we can take controlling measures in an accelerated way.

# 2. COVID19 Global Forecasting

The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) pulled together a coalition research groups and companies (including Kaggle) to prepare the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) to attempt to address key open scientific questions on COVID-19. Here,we will be predicting the cumulative number of confirmed COVID19 cases in various locations across the world, as well as the number of resulting fatalities, for future dates.

### The dataset is uploaded and is available in the 'DATA' folder.
