# COVID-19 Global Forecasting 


Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall on floors or surfaces. 
One can be infected by breathing in the virus if one is within close proximity of someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth.

More information about this deadly virus(along with prevention tips and mandatory precautions) can be found on the World Health Organization(WHO)'s webpage. Other information resources are as follows:
