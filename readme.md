Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall on floors or surfaces. 
One can be infected by breathing in the virus if one is within close proximity of someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth.

More information about this deadly virus(along with prevention tips and mandatory precautions) can be found on the World Health Organization(WHO)'s webpage. Other information resources are as follows:
* https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019 
* https://www.google.com/intl/en_in/covid19/
* https://www.mygov.in/covid-19

So far, this repository composes of a sub directory where we aim to forecast the global confirmed and fatal cases, using time series modeling through **Long Short Term Memory(LSTM)** neural network architecture.

A massively detailed explanation can be found as soon as one navigate into that sub-directory. Our goal was to make the description as detailed as possible, so that any individual new to the field of deep learning can easily understand the mandatory **Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)** and **data pre-processing** steps that were taken along with the subsequent design of the **LSTM network.**

*Global pandemic requires global solutions - and we will get through!*

*A heartfelt thanks to all the front line workers who are continuously defending us from this catastrophe.*
